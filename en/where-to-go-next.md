# Where to Go Next

Now that you've built an app with Xcode, you're ready to start exploring Xcode more and working with Swift to make your app even more engaging.

If you're just starting out with code you can use Apple's Everyone Can Code website or if you want ideas for how to teach \(and learn\) coding, Apple also provides an excellent [Teaching Code website](https://www.apple.com/uk/everyone-can-code).

For more  courses that rely heavily on Xcode. They're called [Intro to App Development with Swift](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/intro-to-app-development-with-swift/id1118575552?mt=11) and [App Development with Swift](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/app-development-with-swift/id1219117996?mt=11), which you can download from [itunes.com/ecc](http://itunes.com/ecc).

These two courses will give you an excellent grounding in how to make apps with Swift, regardless of your coding background. If you'd rather start with the basics of coding, you can start with [Learn to Code 1 & 2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-playgrounds-learn-to-code-1-2/id1118578018?mt=11) and follow on to [Learn to Code 3](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-playgrounds-learn-to-code-3/id1173709121?mt=11). These books will give you a great introduction to Swift and programming concepts you would use across all sorts of programming languages and platforms.

If you're already a little familiar with Swift, you could start with the [Getting Started Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift) to developing iOS apps in which you build an app from start to finish.
