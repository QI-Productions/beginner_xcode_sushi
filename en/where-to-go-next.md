Now that you've built an app with Xcode, you're ready to start exploring Xcode more and working with Swift to make your app even more engaging.

Apple provides two excellent courses that rely heavily on Xcode. They're called [Intro to App Development with Swift](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/intro-to-app-development-with-swift/id1118575552?mt=11) and [App Development with Swift](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/app-development-with-swift/id1219117996?mt=11), which you can download from [itunes.com/ecc](http://itunes.com/ecc).

These two courses will give you an excellent grounding in how to make apps with Swift, regardless of your coding background. If you'd rather start with the basics of coding, you can start with [Learn to Code 1 & 2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-playgrounds-learn-to-code-1-2/id1118578018?mt=11) and follow on to [Learn to Code 3](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-playgrounds-learn-to-code-3/id1173709121?mt=11).
