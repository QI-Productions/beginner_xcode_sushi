# Where to Go Next

Now that you've built an app with Xcode, you're ready to start exploring Xcode more and working with Swift to make your app even more engaging.

Apple provides two excellent courses that rely heavily on Xcode. They're called Intro to App Development with Swift and App Development with Swift, which you can download from [itunes.com/ecc](http://itunes.com/ecc).

This course and App Development with Swift will give you an excellent grounding in how to make apps with Swift, regardless of your coding background. If you'd rather start with the basics of coding, you could read the Learn to Code series, which will give you a great introduction to Swift and programming concepts you would use across all sorts of programming languages and platforms.
