# Making a Minor Change

Now we're going to change a small piece of our user interface.

In the Project Navigator \(the left pane of Xcode\), select the Main.storyboard file.

By selecting this file the middle pane becomes an editor for the user interface of our app.

If you don't see the View Controller Scene on the left hand side of this pane, you can reveal it by selecting the Editor &gt; Show Document Outline menu item.

Open the View Controller Scene by clicking on the disclosure triangle to reveal a View Controller item, and open that to reveal a View item and select it.

The far right pane of Xcode's window is the Utilities pane. This pane will change, depending on the item you have selected. In this case, it shows an inspector for various properties of our view.

Change the color to something other than the default. I've chosen a bright green here.

Click the Run button again to build and run our application.
